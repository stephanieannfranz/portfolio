# My process for this site.

I wanted to create a site that was minimalist, mobile-first, and accessible.

For the mobile-first design, I first thought about how my website would look on a mobile device and then adapted it for larger screens. I drew out the design on paper first, then created the detailed design in Photoshop.

As I wrote the code, I used the ideas behind progressive enhancement, starting first by writing the HTML and then adding styling with CSS later. I used some of the accessibility guidelines from ["Inclusive Design Patterns" by Heydon Pickering](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/inclusive-design-patterns), inclulding writing semantic HTML, making sure the colors/contrast met WCAG standards, and including <script> tags after the content.

I also used [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com) to optimize images and add autoprefixers to my CSS.
